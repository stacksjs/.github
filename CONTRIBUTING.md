# Contributing

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Stacks ecosystem ðŸ’™

## Knowledge Base

This contribution guide is a general guide for all Stacks relating projects. Please also refer to the README of each project for project-specific instructions.

### TypeScript

It's important to note early on that these projects are written with [TypeScript][typescript]. If you're unfamiliar with it or any strongly typed languages, such as Java, then this may feel like a slight roadblock. However, there's never a truly perfect time to start learning it, so ... why not today!

Don't be discouraged, because as you view some of the code examples within the codebase, you will get by learning TypeScript on-the-fly. After all, each project is easy getting startedâ€”the code is extremely readable & approachable!

### Architecture

The project you are working on likely is related to the Stacks ecosystem in some way. Under the hood, they are powered in similar ways: by [Vite][vite] and/or [Bun][bun], UI components of some sort, and composable functions.

An understanding of the library architecture and design will help if you're looking to contribute long-term, or if you are working on a big PR. Browse the source and read each of our documentations to get a better idea on how it is structured. Feel free to ask any question _(Bluesky, Discord, or GitHub Discussions)_, we would love to elaborate.

## Getting Started

As mentioned earlier, it is easy getting started. First off, you will deal with the local project install and setup.

### Install

Please view the README of each project, and the general instructions below on how to install projects locally.

Generally speaking, unless you want to manage `pkgx` dependencies manually, you will need to ensure `pkgx` is installed. `pkgx` then automatically manages the dependencies required for the project.

```bash
# activate pkgx in your project
dev

# install project node_modules
bun install
```

### Project Setup

Most project don't require any further specific project set up and they are ready to run common scripts like:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run dev:docs
bun run build:docs
bun test
# etc.
```

#### Stacks

Head over to the [repository][stacks] on GitHub and click the Fork button in the top right corner. After the project has been forked, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace {github-username} with your GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/{github-username}/stacks --depth=1

cd stacks

# Create a branch for your PR, replace {issue-no} with the GitHub issue number.
git checkout -b issue-{issue-no}
```

Now it'll help if we keep our `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make
pull requests from the forked branch.

```bash
# Add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream".
git remote add upstream git@github.com:stacksjs/stacks.git

# Fetch the git information from the remote.
git fetch upstream

# Set your local main branch to use the upstream main branch whenever you run `git pull`.
git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main

# Run this when we want to update our version of main.
git pull
```

##### Buddy

The following list is of some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API. Meet Artisan:

```bash
buddy install # installs all dependencies
buddy dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, pages, or docs)
buddy build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
buddy commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
buddy release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm

buddy make:component HelloWorld # scaffolds a component
buddy make:function HelloWorld # scaffolds a function
buddy make:page hello-world # scaffolds a page (https://127.0.0.1/hello-world)

buddy help
```

<details>

# `command --help` flag to review the help menu

## Test

### Unit

Each of our components come with test cases. Feel free to check them out within the `./tests` root folder. When adding or or updating functionality, please ensure it is covered through our tests cases. Ensure so by running `bun test`.

## Commit

This project uses [semantic commit messages][semantic-commit-style] to automate package releases. We automated the commit process for you, and simply run `bun run commit` or `buddy commit` in your terminal and follow the instructions.

For example,

```bash
# Add all changes to staging to be committed.
git add .

# Commit changes. (or `bun run commit`)
buddy commit 

# Push changes up to GitHub.
git push
```

## Pull Request

When you're all done, head over to the [repository][stacks], and click the big green `Compare & Pull Request` button that should appear after you've pushed changes to your fork.

Don't expect your PR to be accepted immediately or even accepted at all. Give the community time to vet it and see if it should be merged. Please don't be disheartened if it's not accepted. Your contribution is appreciated more than you can imagine, and even a failed PR can teach us a lot ðŸ’™
